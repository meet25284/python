#arithmetic operator
print(a+b)#this is use to sum
print(a-b)#this is use to sub
print(a*b)#this is use to multiply
print(a/b)#this is use to divide
print(a%b)#this is use to find remaider 
print(a**b)#this is use find a^b


#relational operator
print(a==b)#it means a is equal to b
print(a!=b)#it means a is not equal to b
print(a>b)#it means a is greater than b
print(a<b)#it means a is less than b
print(a>=b)#it means a is greater than equal to b
print(a<=b)#it means a is less than equal to b



#assignment operator
a=b #it mean the value of a is assign in a
print(a)
a+=b #it mean the value of a+b is assign in a
print(a)
a-=b #it mean the value of a-b is assign in a
print(a)
a*=b #it mean the value of a*b is assign in a
print(a)
a/=b #it mean the value of a/b is assign in a
print(a)
a%=b #it mean the value of a%b is assign in a
print(a)
a**=b #it mean the value of a**b is assign in a
print(a)



#logical operator 
a=10
b=4
print(not (a>b))#it mean not true
a1=68
b1=15
print((a>b)and(a1>b1))#it mean both should be true condition
